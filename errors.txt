super object has no attribute 'get_params'
'XGBModel' has no attribute 'feature_types'

in azure deployment takes some time usually around 10-15 mins and if more dependencies is there it will take further more time as compared to aws so this is the feedback over here
else everything is simplar and clear will be able to see logs in form of light stream
